DONE

Run the touchscreen.py to start the application.
This application is done by using Tkinter and python among other libraries such as PyMongo, RPi.GPIO, Time, functools, mfrc522, signal and DateTime.

You need all of the libraries installed on your computer before you can run this application.

This final product is implemented to a RaspBerry Pi 4, which automatically starts this application after rebooting. This Raspberry Pi is connected to a 7'' touchscreen, which means
that the touchscreen.py GUI is rendered fullscreen on the screen. Customers can then use that touchscreen to order drinks/cocktails.
